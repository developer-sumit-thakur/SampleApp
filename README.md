# SampleApp
Sample app using Kotlin, MVVM, Retrofit, LiveData


Primary purpose of this application is to fetch nearby restaurants locations and show the list onto the UI. 

I am following MVVM artitechtural pattern for this project. 

For downloading data from API's, I used retrofit2 REST client which uses OkHttp library for Http requests and using GSON convertor for data serialization.
